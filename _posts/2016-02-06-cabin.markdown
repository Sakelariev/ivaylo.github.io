One of my project in the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree was to "Use R and apply exploratory data analysis techniques to explore relationships in one variable to multiple variables and to explore a selected data set for distributions, outliers, and anomalies". 
We had a couple of data set options for this. I chose to work with the [Red Wine Quality Data set](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/wineQualityReds.csv&sa=D&ust=1527428476240000)
