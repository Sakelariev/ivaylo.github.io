In this Udacity project, I had to investigate a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the Stroop Effect. I learned a little bit about the experiment, created a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the task, then went through the task myself. I then looked at some data collected from others who have performed the same task and computed some statistics describing the results. Finally, I interpreted my results in terms of my hypotheses.
